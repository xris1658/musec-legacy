# HIATUS

This repo will be archived for several reasons:
- This project uses Qt 5.15.2 LTS, which will not be maintained in a few months
- Changing project structure and refactoring are much more difficult than rewrite the project using some legacy code

The renovated project is going underway, which I'll release it later.

# Musec

Musec is a digital audio workstation (DAW) software. Initiated as a graduation project, it is now incomplete and under development.

Check out [Translation.md](./doc/Translation.md) for translating the project.

Check out [HackTheProject.md](./doc/HackTheProject.md) for building and modifying the project.
